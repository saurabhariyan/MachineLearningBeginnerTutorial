Comparison with exsisting tech 
- Uber 
- Facebook
- Google 
- AirBnb

All of them are result of connectivity being easy. Faster and cheap internet and the second order effects of the same. 

We have not yet seen the first order effects of machine learning and artificial intellegnece in action. 
Imagining a world where the second order effects is still kinda weird. 


Thought experiments: 

- +ve effects: 
   - study for earth like planets based on the similarity of ohter variables. 
   - targeted medicine based on the genome project and the your particular disease strain.
   - UAV noticing forest fire before it reaches critical mass and spriking water over it. 

- neutral effects:
   - A fitbit which has access to your resting heart rate and other such information, pushes you drugs based on that. 
   - Stock Market Transactions getting blocked or flagged based on anamonly detection. 2 level : the company itself is anamoly, the transactio. 


- -ve effects: 
   - targeted ransomeware attacks. Instead of the whole data dump how about doing image recognistion and finding the all the porn stash in your computer 
   - medical records manipulation : terror network targeting NHS record
