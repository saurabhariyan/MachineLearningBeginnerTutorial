>ABOUT THE TRAINING

Building and deploying web applications with confidence is challenging. Verifying that what you’re deploying to production actually works requires a solid suite of automated tests. Knowing how to configure tools and write tests that enhance your development experience is vital to your success.

In this class, we’ll explore the merits and tradeoffs of different forms of testing and get into configuring and using specific tools to increase confidence in deploying our applications.

Join Kent C. Dodds and learn invaluable skills you can take back to improve your JavaScript applications.

You will:

Learn the why, how, where, and what to test.
Explore the difference between various forms of testing.
Set up the tooling for unit and integration tests using Jest.
